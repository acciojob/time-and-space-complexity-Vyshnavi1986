	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is understood as time taken by aprogram to run and complete the given task. As a programme, your goal should betoreducethe time complexity  of the code by optimizing it and making it more efficient.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b>is related to the amount of memory occupied by the program. For example, if a program takes an array of size n as input, the space  complexity of the program is O(n)</p>
